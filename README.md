[00:23.88] You paint a picture in my mind
[00:29.20] You wanna leave it all behind
[00:34.69] In a world that's turning all the time
[00:39.76] Nothing could stop me longing for your eyes
[01:01.26] 
[00:45.04] I won't let it die
[00:50.19] I can feel you when you're not around
[00:56.09] When the night gets cold
[01:00.13] I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't be alone
[01:05.70] We won't be alone
[01:14.20] 
[01:08.56] We won't, we won't
[01:17.56] 
[01:14.09] We won't, we won't
[01:19.67] We won't, we won't
[01:25.09] We won't be alone
[01:33.59] 
[01:46.94] We won't be alone
[01:55.44] 
[01:51.60] This lake of fire burns my skin
[01:57.11] How could love wear so thin?
[02:02.59] I'm sinking in the hollow ground
[02:07.51] Nothing can stop me wanting you somehow
[02:27.01] 
[02:12.93] I won't let it die
[02:17.80] I can feel you when you're not around
[02:23.83] When the night gets cold
[02:28.05] I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't be alone
[02:33.50] We won't be alone
[02:42.00] 
[02:36.42] We won't, we won't
[02:39.13] We won't, we won't
[02:41.85] We won't be alone
[02:47.12] We won't, we won't
[02:50.26] We won't, we won't
[02:52.80] We won't be alone
[03:01.30] 
[03:14.79] We won't be alone
[03:23.29] 
[03:29.95] I won't let it die
[03:34.88] I can feel you when you're not around
[03:40.89] When the night gets cold
[03:47.55] We won't be alone
